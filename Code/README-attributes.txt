Animals with Attributes Dataset, v1.0, May 13th 2009
------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal/attribute matrix for 50 animal categories and 85 attributes.
Animals and attributes are in the same order as in the text files
'classes.txt' and 'predictes.txt'.

The numeric data was originally collected by Osherson et al. [1], 
and extended by Kemp et al. [2]. Augmenting image data was collected
by Lampert et al. [3] (http://attributes.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de).

Missing values in the numeric table are marked by -1. The binary 
matrix was created by thresholding the continuous table at the 
overall mean.
