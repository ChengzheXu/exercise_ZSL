Images in JPEG format of 50 animals classes. 

** Disclaimer: The images in this archive are NOT the ones   **
** of the original "Animals with Attributes (AwA)" dataset   **
** http://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA from the publications [3,4].    ** 
** Those images are currently not publicly available.        **

The dataset is constructed as a plug-in replacement of the AwA dataset,
and it has similar charactersitics as the original "Animals with 
Attributes" dataset  (same classes, similar number of 
images per classes, ...). 

The images in this archive were collected in 2016 from public web 
sources (Flickr, Wikimedia,...). While collecting, we made sure that 
all images were accompanied by a license that allows free use and 
redistribution, see the included "licenses" folder. 
In the case that you hold the copyright to one or more of the included 
images and you did not actually release them under the indicated 
license, please let us know and we will update the information 
or remove the image from the collection.  


As far as possible, we made sure that there is no overlap between
the new Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) dataset and the  images of 
the original Animals with Attributes (AwA) dataset.
